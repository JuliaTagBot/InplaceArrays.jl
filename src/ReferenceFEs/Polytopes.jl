    abstract type Polytope{D}

Abstract type representing a polytope (i.e., a polyhedron in arbitrary dimensions).
`D` is the environment dimension (typically, 0, 1, 2, or 3).
This type parameter is needed since there are functions in the 
`Polytope` interface that return containers with `Point{D}` objects.
We adopt the [usual nomenclature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope) for polytope-related objects.
All objects in a polytope (from vertices to the polytope itself) are called *n-faces* or simply *faces*.
The notation *n-faces* is used only when it is needed to refer to the object dimension n. Otherwise we simply
use *face*. In addition, we say

- vertex (pl. vertices): for 0-faces
- edge: for 1-faces
- facet: for (`D-1`)-faces

The `Polytope` interface is defined by overloading the following functions

- [`get_faces(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`get_dimrange(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`Polytope{N}(p::Polytope,faceid::Integer) where N`](@ref)
- [`vertex_coordinates(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`(==)(a::Polytope{D},b::Polytope{D}) where D`](@ref)

And optionally these ones:

- [`edge_tangents(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`facet_normals(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`facet_orientations(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`vertex_permutations(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`get_vtkid(p::Polytope)`](@ref)
- [`get_vtknodes(p::Polytope)`](@ref)

The interface can be tested with the function

- [`test_polytope`](@ref)

"""
    get_faces(p::Polytope) -> Vector{Vector{Int}}

Given a polytope `p` the function returns a vector of vectors
defining the *incidence* relation of the faces in the polytope.

Each face in the polytope receives a unique integer id. The id 1 is assigned
to the first 0-face. Consecutive increasing ids are assigned to the other
0-faces, then to 1-faces, and so on. The polytope itself receives the largest id
which coincides with `num_faces(p)`. For a face id `iface`, `get_faces(p)[iface]`
is a vector of face ids, corresponding to the faces that are *incident* with the face
labeled with `iface`. That is, faces that are either on its boundary or the face itself. 
In this vector of incident face ids, faces are ordered by dimension, starting with 0-faces.
Within each dimension, the labels are ordered in a consistent way with the polyope object
for the face `iface` itself.

# Examples

```jldoctest
using InplaceArrays.ReferenceFEs

faces = get_faces(SEGMENT)
println(faces)

# output
Array{Int64,1}[[1], [2], [1, 2, 3]]
```

The constant [`SEGMENT`](@ref) is bound to a predefined instance of polytope
that represents a segment.
The face labels associated with a segment are `[1,2,3]`, being `1` and `2` for the vertices and 
`3` for the segment itself. In this case, this function would return the vector of vectors
`[[1],[2],[1,2,3]]` meaning that vertex `1` is incident with vertex `1` (idem for vertex 2), and that 
the segment (id `3`) is incident with the vertices `1` and `2` and the segment itself.

    get_dimrange(p::Polytope) -> Vector{UnitRange{Int}}

# Examples

```jldoctest
